Ok so i did not know it was this simple to add pages on github. Nowhere is found i just had to push a jekyll page on the gh-pages branch. So i did not.

Now i did so i can show you my admin page css template. It's based upon [bootstrap(4)][bootstrap] and uses [font awesome][fontawesome]

[bootstrap]: http://getbootstrap.com
[fontawesome]: http://fontawesome.io
