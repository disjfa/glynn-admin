I updated some small things today, i wanted to add a profile page and add an image on the bottom of the menu.
The first succeeded, the latter not so much. I played around with paddings and margins, but when the menu was too large i just could not put the profile button outside the screen.
So i opted for the next best thing, add it on the top. It worked, you can check it out in the menu.
I added a image on it, i use [unsplash.con][unsplash] for pictures. This one is from [Chris Leggat][unsplash-image].

On the profile page i also added some [social buttons][bootstrap-social].

I also played around with sizes, The menu on tablets (768px) is now a bit wider.

Oh, and some colors. I moved over to some [flat colors][flatuicolors] and upgraded the sidebar to encorporate one color and some variations.
