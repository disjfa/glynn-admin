#### Sub menu

So i had a submenu, but i did not implement that. Now i did, i created a submenu with some empty pages so you can experience a submenu. You can check it out
clicking the "menu levels" page in the menu. It is quite cool. It just uses the collapse plugin built in bootstrap. You can use a third menu layer from the scss
files, but i do not know if i will implement that in the future, cause jekyll is quite nifty on that front.

#### Forms

Also i added a page with some default form examples. You can check it out on the "Forms" button in the menu. I will add on that in the future, to create some nifty features.
For now, it just is a default setup using html5 form validation.

#### Bootstrap 4

Oh i did check out the new alpha3 from the people of [bootstrap][bootstrap-blog]. Things i noticed is the font changes, super nice and relaxing on the eyes.
Double checked if nothing broke on my pages but it did not. So i can get my hands on the rest of the code. Lets play.
