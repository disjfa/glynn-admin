#### Symfony

I see html examples on the internet and think i miss the examples in the real world. So i started a symfony project and incapsulated this nice template and styles. I set it up with an actual user frontend using the [FOSUserBundle][fosuser]. And exaple menu builder you can actually use, using the [KnpMenuBundle][KnpMenuBundle]. You can find it on the [github page][glynn-admin-symfony].

#### Submenu

When i was setting up the symfony bundle i could create menus and found the third level was not styled. I did want to do that so i updated the styles. Now it does, nice.
