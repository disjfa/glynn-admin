#### Sub menu

An icon, i had a title on the page but no icon. And i wanted an icon. So i went out on the internet and search for one. Found one in the arabica coffee bean.
I found it on a [smashing magazine freebee][smashing-magazine-barista], added a fill color and placed it. On a mobile view i still added a title, just to be nice.

#### Charts.js

A dashboard is not complete without a chart, and on of the best plugins for charts online is [charts.js][chartjs]. So i added a simple example for a chart on the dashboard. Enjoy.
